netdata-json
============

A fun little library for relating Net.Data tables to JSON objects. Facilitates the use of front-end frameworks like Backbone.js or Ember.js with a Net.Data back end. Usage is documented in-line, to some extent.

This project was built as a collaboration between [Black Chair Studios, Inc.](http://www.blackchair.net) and [BMTS Intranet, Inc.](http://bmtsintranet.com)
